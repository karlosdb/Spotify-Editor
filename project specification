A project specification : project purpose, methodologies, appearance, and user
interface

Project Purpose:
    This is an application to make it easier to add/remove songs from playlists. I wanted
    to make this app because in default spotify, adding/removing songs from a playlists
    takes a right click and a menu browse to do. Which is very arduous when doing it for
    large amounts of songs, such as if you are going through a new playlist and looking
    for songs to add to your other playlists, or if you were looking to clean out a large playlist.
    I also added the function of 'moving' a song, meaning, delete it from the current playlist
    and move it to another specified playlist.
    This is all meant to be done in a fairly lightweight way, either by clicking hotkeys or
    pressing a button in a simple GUI.

Methodologies:
    Of course I had to figure out how to use the spotify API for this application. Also uses a lot
    of the 'keyboard' module, for hotkeys. The controller utilizes Tkinter, and doesn't directly control
    the main app, it just sends virtual keypresses corresponding to the hotkeys of the main console app.
    For this reason, the controller must be launched separately, as I could not make it work with the console
    app simultaneously and directly.
    The project was originally created to just be a console app, and the GUI was just an add-on in order to
    make learning all the hotkeys optional.

Appearance:
    The main app is just a console app, printing out necessary information. The GUI is a separate Tkinter app to interface with
    the console app without having to press the hotkeys.

Interface:
    The user has to interface with the console app directly when logging in, and when choosing playlists for focus options. The rest is done
    through keyboard hotkeys either through the GUI or directly by the user using their keyboard. All updated information is displayed in the
    console app.
